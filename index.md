<center><h4>Hey there!</h4></center>
My name is Rakesh Bal , I am from Bhubaneswar , Odisha. I am pursuing my undergaduate studies in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering. <br>
Interested in the field of Data Science, I love learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts , as it's everywhere and as **Andrew Ng** says it's the new electricty !<br>
Though I am very busy during normal days, I love to I code all the time and learn. 

And all this is possible because of the great community IIT Kharagpur has !


**Some great seniors and cheerful friends is all you need to stay motivated !**<br>

If interested , here's my [Resume](/resume.pdf). <br/>
