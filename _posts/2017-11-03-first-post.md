## Hello World!<br>
Okay so I had already made a portfolio website but it didnot have that appeal and lacked professionalism. I was still sticking around with it until I saw [Rohit Kumar Jena's](https://github.com/rohitrango) portfolio. I was amazed that how simplistic he  had made his portfolio.<br>
Straight to the point, No Flashy!.<br>
I found that he used the [Beutiful Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). But it still needed a bit of work to be used directly. So I used my friend [Sangeet Kumar Mishra](https://github.com/sangeet259) work as he had used the same template. So here I am presenting my first blog in jekyll.<br>
So <br>
