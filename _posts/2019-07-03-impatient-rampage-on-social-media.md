With the rage that is social media, a substantial number of people are now having the platform and freedom to write and say whatever they want and whenever they want. But therein lies an inherent problem which I wanted to discuss here in this post. I believe there are two main reasons behind this phenomena we are witnessing now-a-days. If you don't agree with what I say, that's fine but its a humble request not to judge this post just on the basis of a few lines.

Now perhaps I have briefly touched upon what I am trying to bring out in this post in the last line. But to make it clear the first reason is the impatience that people exhibit on social media platforms which is one of the root causes of all the toxicity that is prevalent now. The impulsive reactions of the people on reading or hearing about something is troublesome and that is because people are impatient and lack the endeavour to properly get informed about the topic before having rigid opinions. People are consistently, forgetting that one of the greatest human strengths which has enabled us to reach this far is our inherent ability to understand and comprehend language in various types and forms. Be it visual or verbal we understand ourselves in a manner like no other being. And the reason behind our effectives lies in our impeccable capability to pick context out of a sentence and infer them in a way which is unique to every possible situation and thus helping us to distinguish between various contexts. This I feel is what makes us so unique and such a force to reckon with. Context is probably one of the most important parameters to consider while having opinions about something if not the most important one. Now coming back to Social Media this context is missing lots of times in various conversations or people just blindfold themselves to such contexts resulting in replies in a judgmental fashion. To be very honest even I am guilty of this baton of missing out on context on many occasions. There are many occasions where people just outrageously jump into conclusions without knowing what they are talking about which is very worrisome. I won't give any such examples as that would reflect my personal bias and I leave it to the reader to figure out for themselves if whatever I am saying makes any sense to them and if they agree with me. There have been numerous occasions where I have been misunderstood also I have misunderstood various other people and that brings me to my second reason.

Most of times people having conversations on these types of platforms are not interacting face to face and many times they are just texts or chats. Saying something orally usually has a lot more gravitas and clarity as opposed to when you say something just textually. What I mean to say is that there is a lot of room for people to misunderstand you because they are not being able to fathom what is the tone of your saying. Whether it is sarcastic or serious or just straight out plain information sharing. I strongly believe that the majority of what is said in social media won't be said by people if they were interacting with people in person. Or at least they will fully grasp what the other person has to say with proper context and then decide whether it should be opposed or not. This remoteness in our daily conversations is increasing day by day which is why I think there is a need for reform among the people using these platforms.

To summarize, people should be more open to hearing what others have to say and try to engineer their minds and reason why that person is saying the way he/she is. I know this is a huge task that I have just stated in a sentence and is very very improbable for people to inculcate this methodology into their veins but it is a route which is worth pursuing as how radically different our ideologies might be collectively we are all championing the same cause in all our hearts i.e. our survival and the sustenance of the earth we are living in. **It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you.**
