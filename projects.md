### Project list
<hr>
### Discovering and Mitigating Algorithmic Bias using Deep Neural Networks

*   #### Guide: Prof. Niloy Ganguly

    * Working on discovering bias in COMPAS dataset using deep neural networks.

    * Formulating ideas for its mitigation using Layerwise Relevance Propagation technique.

### Team AUV Projects

*   #### Guide: Prof. CS Kumar

    ##### Object Detection

    *   Implemented real time under water buoy detection using lighter version of MobileNet and YOLO Object Detection architectures.
    *   Working on making the inference of models lightweight and suitable for the bot using Movidius NCS.

    ##### Mission Planner

    *   Implemented Mission Planner in ROS to perform actions and take decisions.
    *   Used Actionlib and Smach Packages of ROS to implement Mission Planner.

* * *

### Self Projects

*   #### Convolutional Sequence To Sequence Learning

    ##### fairseq-py

    *   Studied and analysed the research paper on Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning.
    *   Analysed the results on the pre-trained models for Fair-Seq in PyTorch by noting their BLEU score and trained new models from scratch.

*   #### A Recommender System App

    ##### synisto

    *   Wrote a python for python script for recommending movies to users based on their historical choices.
    *   Used Restricted Boltzman Machines to recontruct user's ratings.
    *   Used Matrix Factorization to predict user's rating for movies he/she hasn't seen.
