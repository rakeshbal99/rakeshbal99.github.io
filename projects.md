<hr>
### Team AUV Projects

*   #### Object Detection

    ##### Mission-Planner

    *   Implemented Mission Planner in ROS to perform actions and take decisions.
    *   Used Actionlib and Smach Packages of ROS to implement Mission Planner.

    ##### Fatser RCNN for Object Detection

    *   Studied and implementing Faster R-CNN for Real-Time Object Detection and Localization. 

    ##### HSV Thresholding

    *   Implemented an Thresholding algorithm using the HSV color space to segment buoy from the surroundings.
    *   Thresholds based on the hue, saturation, and value of the buoy.

* * *

### Self Projects

*   #### Convolutional Sequence To Sequence Learning

    ##### fairseq-py

    *   Studied and analysed the research paper on Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning.
    *   Analysed the results on the pre-trained models for Fair-Seq in PyTorch by noting their BLEU score and trained new models from scratch.

*   #### A Recommender System App [under construction]

    ##### synisto

    *   Wrote a python for python script for recommending movies to users based on their historical choices.
    *   Used Restricted Boltzman Machines to recontruct user's ratings.
    *   Used Matrix Factorization to predict user's rating for movies he/she hasn't seen.

*   #### Scientific calculator Python

    ##### Calculator

    *   Developed a calculator app in python using standard library.
    *   Used Python GUI framework PySide to implement the GUI.
    *   Used Qt Designer for designing the GUI part.
