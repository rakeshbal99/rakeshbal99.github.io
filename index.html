<p>I am an MLOps Engineer at <a href="https://stovell.ai/">Stovell AI Systems</a> based in San Francisco. I received my M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/">University of California Los Angeles</a> in June 2023. In the past, I completed my undergraduate degree from <em>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</em> at <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> in May 2020.</p>

<p>I maintain a list of my research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research">Research</a> tab. To get an insight on my professional life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">CV</a>.</p>

<p>I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_temples_in_Bhubaneswar">Temple City of India</a>. I have spent most of my childhood in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puri">Puri</a>, the last of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_Dham">Char Dhams</a> according to Hindu tradition. Puri and nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konark">Konark</a> together house some of the most breathtaking beaches and exquisite temples in all of Odisha and are absolutely worth a visit!</p>

<p>I <a href="/archive">blog</a> sometimes, usually compiling my personal experiences. However, occasionally I am compelled to give those experiences a <a href="/poems">poetic</a> touch. Feel free to read a bit <a href="/about">more about me</a>!</p>
