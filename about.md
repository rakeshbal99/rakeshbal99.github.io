I completed my bachelors and masters in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) respectively. My research interests revolve around Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Fairness aspects of various AI Domains.

In the past, I have interned at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** in the **Machine Learning Solutions Lab (MLSL)** team working on Drug Target Intearction using Protein based Large Language Models. I have also interned at **Accenture Technology Labs, Bangalore** where I worked on Stock Price Prediction using textual data like news articles or twitter data.

My full experiences include Goldman Sachs, where I focused on full-stack web development using Angular, Spring, Apache Kafka, and MongoDB, leading to the deployment of applications serving over 10,000 users. Currently, I am an MLOps Engineer at Stovell AI Systems in San Francisco.

In my free time, I like to play chess and catch up with recent developments in the chess community. Checkout these rising young talents from India - **[D Gukesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukesh_Dommaraju)**, **[Arjun Erigaisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Erigaisi)** and **[R Praggnanandhaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rameshbabu_Praggnanandhaa)**.

I love watching movies and I am a huge huge fan of **Christopher Nolan**. I have watched all of his films (even *Insomnia*, *Doodlebug* and *Following*). Watching Oppenheimer in IMAX 70mm was a special experience and will always be etched in my memory as the first magnum opus from Nolan that I could watch in the mighty format. Among Indian films, my favourite is a Tamil movie named *96* which features one of my favourite **[soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZZLqoRuuHw)**. I also follow a handful of series like *Sacred Games*, *Dark*, *Sherlock*, *Westworld*, *Planet Earth*, *The Family Man* and *Black Mirror* but my favourite series is a Japanese Anime called *Attack on Titan*. You can also follow me on **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/rakeshbal99/)** where I have listed almost all of the films I have watched.
