As I peel through the layers of my failure  
My past self seeking my redemption  
I hear the last screams of my self esteem  
Raving through the room  
Rising through the metal throne  
Valiantly failing in breaching the zone

No one shall remember me my friend, will you?  
I have spent my entire life in a dream  
A dream that led me to get up tomorrow  
But tomorrow is a dream too high, my friend  
Too high for me to reach the pinncale  
Even though I have never been cynical.

In this flashback of sorts  
I find myself dying a thousand deaths  
Yet I am not a coward, my friend  
I have put my heart and soul in that fight  
But I have lost all the battles in a single slope  
Not due to weakness, but due to hope.

A simple hope, a simple idea  
That my life would lighten up again  
Where I shall forget all my snubs  
But now I hide my tears in the dark  
The dark that has embraced me unlike any other  
And it has made me forget myself  
And this is where you shall find a new me,  
Not a hero or a villain  
But an agent of chaos.
