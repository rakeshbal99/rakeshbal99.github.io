description: "A villanelle about two opposing figures."

There were two young men,  
Devoted to an illusion;  
One born out of anger, the other out of pain.

Both failed time and time again  
Engulfed deep inside the pit of deception;  
There were two young men.

People looked at them with disdain,  
Two persons evolved out of this confusion;  
One born out of anger, the other out of pain.

It was their search for paths when,  
One vouched for a symbol, the other for aggressive expansion;  
There were two young men.

Their conflict had nothing to entertain,  
Still both had no time for caution;  
One born out of anger, the other out of pain.

One lived long enough to become the villain,  
The other lived enough to become the sensation.  
There were two young men,  
One born out of anger, the other out of pain.
