description: "A poem about fire, pain, and destiny."
---

Do you see the fire?  
The flame beneath the desire,  
The rage against the abyss of time  
A long forgotten hero looking at his prime

Do you see the pain?  
Of a man never ever found again  
The suffering that is the shepard tone  
Of the blade running through metal throne.

Do you see the anger?  
The hammered soul of a stranger,  
Beseeched upon himself the free will  
To live the life of someone without any refill.

Those men had nothing except grim  
And they did not mean anything to him  
Yet, He chose to be the outcast  
Which earned him nothing other than backlash.

Do you see the danger?  
Because now you need the stranger  
Because now you have to find him  
Because now you have to chase him  
Because now you have to hunt him  
Because now he is the chosen one.
