description: "A poem about societal judgement."

He was found on the ground,  
Lying unconscious, perhaps breathing his last,  
People gathered quickly,  
Took him to the hospital,  
And he got his life back.

"He has got a second life",  
They said without knowing how he felt.  
Now the inevitable question aroused,  
"How do you think it happened?"  
As usual, all had their theories.

Was he trying to commit suicide?  
"My room is always open to everyone", one commented.  
Such a coward he is, trying to run away from life.  
One asked, "Did he have a girlfriend?"  
The answer is, it does not matter.

With all the murmurs that are inevitable,  
The damage is done, and the person has  
Forever fallen into the wide scrutiny of the society,  
Forever present whenever he tries to do something new.  
The real question is whether he would be able to break free  
And really introspect what did he do that day  
Or would he just accept the society's wonderfully spun story?
