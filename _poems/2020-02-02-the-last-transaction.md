description: "A love letter in verse about enduring affection"
---

What is this pain I seek?  
It was done and dusted ages ago  
My tryst with your destiny  
Should have fallen apart,  
But even today I find  
The locks of your hair  
In the dreams of my dear love.

In the awkward moments  
Of the painstaking self reveal  
Of how I fell in love with you;  
The innocent heart of that kid  
Waving for affection; free from malice;  
Relishing the ravaging wind  
Riding the hovercraft of life, finding  
Eternity in your sublime presence  
Like the lilacs flaunting  
The fragrance of their blossoms.

This is no love poem  
This is a letter to my love  
An open letter, asking no replies  
I seek to inform you of my pain  
I live in solitude now  
The long awaken distance defies our unity  
But my love for you is sans any condition  
You were my true friend;  
You are my ghost;  
And you shall forever be my heartbeat  
Even in my death, my last transaction.
