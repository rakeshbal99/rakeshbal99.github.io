As a child, I listened to his songs  
Day in and day out,  
Not knowing his nationality,  
Or his religion.  
To that 10-year-old me,  
He was my favourite singer,  
Not knowing anything about music,  
He transcended my senses.

The soulful voice that he had  
Reminded how beautiful the  
The world was, Until a few horrific attacks  
Changed everything at once.

He and his fellow countrymen  
Were banned to perform  
In my country and rarely sing  
A song in our movies now.

Whenever he does it becomes  
An instant hit amongst the masses.  
Reminding everyone of those  
Glorious golden days.

Was he responsible for those attacks?  
Does he belonging to that community  
Does any harm to me or my country?  
The answer is, it does not matter.

Those songs which he has sung  
With his heart and passion,  
Would never be forgotten,  
And would remind people that  
There are people on the other side  
Who are exactly like us and  
Lost brothers in the battle that was.
