You are my childhood  
The naive face once worn  
By someone who had no  
Reason but to always mourn.

You are my youth  
That frivolous ambition  
Praying and visiting temples  
Just to get an admission.

You are my friends  
Those stack of inspiring men,  
From inspirational stories,  
Inspiring each other time and time again.

You are my parents  
The essence of compassion,  
Sometimes rude, sometimes forgiving  
But no one knows their satisfaction.

You are me  
The wandering soul  
The epitome of the past  
Looking for a grassy knoll to stroll.

You take infinite forms  
Sometimes an oasis, sometimes the trance  
But people came back to you  
Whenever they need a glance.
