description: "A poem about success and criticism."
---

His first foray was a big success,  
Audiences and critics liked it alike,  
The baggage of applause that was to follow  
Was a bit hard for him to swallow.

The idea of topping himself drove him crazy,  
His success, his antagonist.  
Blinded by the pressure on the shore  
He crumbled down to the very core.

The atrocious despise that followed  
On his second venture  
Made him think of a different validation,  
A path which led to less public humiliation.

Alas how futile his efforts really were  
Every now and then he would  
Encounter the same disdain  
From people who had nothing to ascertain.

The very people that demonize others,  
Are those who cannot look straight.  
The very people that are shabby,  
Are those who lie to themselves to be happy.
