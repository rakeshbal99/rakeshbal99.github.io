Like a distant dream, I muse  
Those glorious golden days  
As we share the distant views;  
Of our journey to the mighty gaze  
Of those large round eyes  
Waving and praying to let go of our lies.

As the smog clears, I recall the emotion  
The smell of those tiny streets, the beat  
And the whistle of the great ocean;  
So close yet so far, waving even in the retreat  
From beyond the horizon, so nigh  
Trying to get over the walls so high.

We wept together in your demise  
Perhaps she was loved more by the divine  
As we garnered the feeling of despise,  
We realised there was no reason to malign  
In life there are many deaths many separations  
One can only hope to meet again in other incarnations.

You stole my piece, my first shot  
But you gave me my smile  
Come back to me, the times long forgot  
Those melodies are lost in your exile  
I write to remind you of our last scream  
We shall meet again, my friend, in a distant dream.
