description: "A poem about legacy and the pursuit of meaning"
---

I want my heart out there  
Finding the piece that I do want to share  
The one which would edge my legacy  
Deep enough for it to be altered by destiny  
Deep enough for people not to forget  
Helping them in the worst of their regret  
I am still waiting for the magic to surface  
Sitting in my room, looking at my face  
It's been four years since I did anything  
Languishing at the lamp grin I sing  
Nothing but the forlorn hymn  
Of my life filled with soporific grim  
Of how I shall one day shine  
All in hope to crack the last line.
