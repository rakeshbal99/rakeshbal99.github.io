description: "A poem about dreams, secrets, and destiny."
---

Waking up from a half-remembered dream,  
With the river gushing through my head  
I am lost in the building in the glow  
Or in the woods in the snow  
The secret that shall set me free  
Is hidden deep beneath the floor  
Which shall be blasted by the door  
And now I am looking for the secret  
Hidden deep inside the brass  
Of the slow-paced music  
I shall wait for the train  
It is a long journey that I shall make  
Four to Five stations waiting in disguise  
I don't care about the destination anymore  
Destiny is all that counts  
In slow motion, I shall Dance  
And in that trance, I shall make my own destiny  
And when you come finding me  
Remember to look for the secret  
That has set me free  
And then shall you  
Find me on the edge of the cliff  
Waiting for you my friend  
Filled with the regret of our sins  
We shall jump down to the sky  
And there shall I again  
Wake up from a half-forgotten dream.
