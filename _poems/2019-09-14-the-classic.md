You blew me away,  
With just a viewing.  
The intricacy of an idea so convoluted,  
Told with such precision,  
Could not be credited just by an ovation.

Bamboozled by the theory,  
So complicated yet so relatable,  
I hoped to see you get awards and acclaim,  
The result that the snub was,  
Made my heart yearn with remorse.

Will the history books  
Forget the telling of such an epic,  
Will the audience remember a masterpiece  
Of that calibre, never made before  
The answer is, it does not matter.

You are the true bearer of a masterpiece,  
Deep down if you know it's great,  
It shall rise from the ashes dug  
Deep beneath the box office and awards  
And there shall you see the story of a  
Silent guardian, a watchful protector  
A cult classic.
