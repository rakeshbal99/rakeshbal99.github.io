description: "A dark poem about crime, judgment, and suspicion"
---

In the noon of the murder  
You shall never see the victim  
The dead corpse panting for life  
Breathing his last under the bloody knife

The swarms will chatter the noise  
Of the flesh and blood  
But no one knows how to keep time  
Other than the man with the crime

He has left his body  
This is his judgement day;  
The day he has long craved for  
Leaving the eternal sans fear

Noon dwells to the dark  
And here comes the usual suspect  
Pointing fingers you shall utter the cry  
That's the f*ckin bad guy.
