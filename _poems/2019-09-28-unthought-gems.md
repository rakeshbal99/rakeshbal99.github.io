description: "A poem about creating and validation."

The idea was intimidating,  
Perhaps the very reason  
I chose to stay it hidden  
From other people's treason.

The fear of validation is,  
An emotion which is everlasting.  
It can be as encouraging,  
As it can be devastating.

Eventually, the perpetual voice,  
Superseded my reluctance,  
To bring to this world,  
Something which had no existence.

The tranquil of giving birth  
To something which was conceived  
By me, is a sensation  
That would forever remain unvanquished.

The panic has now subsided,  
And I have become free to any affirmation,  
And you are free to denounce  
To any extent without any hesitation.

I have left my legacy behind,  
But the gems that you pick up,  
From the ocean of thought,  
Will define who you truly are.
