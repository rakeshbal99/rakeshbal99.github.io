description: "A poem about loss, rage, and the promise of comeback"
---

In my last moments of peace  
You snatched my home  
The dwell that was my life  
My last ray of hope  
Striving to make it an abode.

You may call me mediocre  
Your attempt to console with sweet words  
Is as futile as your empathy  
I am heart wrenched now  
Because I lost my body  
My soul too is in a dilemma  
To pardon my failure  
Or leave me for eternity.

But you rest assured  
You have entered a burning buliding  
And you shall feel the heat  
My rage pouring out my wrath  
The comeback of sorts; which you shall remember  
For the rest of your lives  
As your younger generation will  
Remind you whenever you forget  
My love my home my snub my last say  
All looking to avenge that fateful day.
