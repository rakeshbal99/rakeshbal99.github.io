description: "A poem about the consequences of power and betrayal"
---

It's the grandeur your strength you claim,  
You could not be more wrong,  
For never have people remembered your surname,  
You see voice never dies, it resonates with the song,  
The song that shall forever rave,  
The stories of those betrayed,  
The homes of whom were destroyed by the wave,  
Caused by you in the name of aid,  
You had the power to change history,  
But you used it in the name of campaign,  
Even though you have achieved victory,  
The sobs of the deceived shall haunt you again,  
For the rest of your immortal time,  
For pain is nothing but an eternal rhyme.
