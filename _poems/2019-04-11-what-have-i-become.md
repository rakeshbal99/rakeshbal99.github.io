What Have I become?  
Is it a failure?  
Or Is it bad luck?  
Or am I incompetent?  
I have become the person  
That I feared the most.

The one who would do  
His homework the same day  
Now is unable to understand  
The question itself.  
What Have I become?

The one who would kill  
Himself at the thought of  
Not attending classes  
Now gets goosebumps at  
The thought of going to one of them.

The one who aced all exams  
Now glances at the  
Risk of repeating a course.  
What Have I become?

The one who would give  
Anything to bounce back  
After a failure, now lives in  
The shadows of other people.

The one who studied even while  
He was travelling  
Now asks for the syllabus  
An hour before the exam.

The lad who was sure  
About his decisions  
Now doubts whether  
He can ever be sure in life.

The one who would surprise  
Himself with his achievements  
Now is not surprised  
By his failures.

What Have I become?  
Can I ever get back  
To my old self?  
I have become the person  
That I feared the most.
