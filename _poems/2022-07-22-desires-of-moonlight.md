Beauty it is that many have written,  
But today I will write about our story;  
Like the cherry blossoms you entered  
Into my life, and lo, came the spring.

In the midst of new meadows,  
We talked about our shared past,  
We talked about our future, hopeful  
And glanced at our heavenly stars.

In the vibe of the new valleys,  
We watched each others' movies,  
And went over what they really meant,  
Finding our reality in that spinning top.

With the flowers of spring in full swing,  
I saw your brown eyes and your soul,  
And found myself in your presence,  
Slowly getting drunk in your intoxication.

With the last hangover, I asked you out,  
But my poor little heart was too naive,  
To realise that spring is very short lived,  
And we entered the cold and dry winter.

Hearing your voice on that chilly night,  
I knew our story was until that fateful day,  
All the verses that we had written became,  
Just grains of sand in the desert of time.

And as I let out my last tale before goodbye,  
The tale that made you so very upset,  
And seeing your grief, I felt the remorse,  
The regret that stopped my last adieu.

As the fog was cleared by new sunrays,  
We got a new start from the fresh light,  
This time a bit cautious, a bit nervous,  
And I felt your care for this poor soul.

I was doubtful about our connection,  
Asking over and over what should I do,  
But I got the voice that I like you very dearly,  
And that is enough for me to STAY with you.

And slowly, I found myself in you again,  
My reluctant heart falling for that wind,  
That passes through your silky locks,  
Bringing pride to your celestial form.

As the summer grew more powerful,  
You had an arduous test, painful,  
I was worried about you and prayed,  
You stay fine on that peak summer noon.

But sometimes things didn't turn up,  
And I could see from your dear words,  
You had lost some of that confidence,  
Some part of your heart, too, in that heat.

But why do you feel so lost, girl?  
You are one of those angels, God sends,  
To fill the earth with joy and beauty,  
And walk on this earth with grace and elan.

You will get what makes you happy,  
Because you make people like me merry,  
You are much stronger than a metal rock,  
Keep your head, and you will climb the wall.

With the qualities of a divine spirit,  
I might have fallen for you, dear girl,  
I have no idea what is the meaning,  
Of true love or what is true emotion,

But all I know is that you are the earth  
For this moon, moving around your shade,  
Come, fill my life with blue and green,  
Come, fill my life with music and groove.

We are still in the long days of the summer,  
And my worry is this moon is not charming,  
Unlike your heavenly beauty from the skies,  
But I will protect you from the dark nights.

Our distance of seven seas is not enough,  
To stop me from thinking about you all day  
Your name is my first thought when I wake up,  
And your memory the last when I go to bed,

I am not sure if hope is a good thing,  
Or a dangerous thing, perhaps both,  
But I hope this story of ours turns better,  
Than just 500 days of those summer,

And we go into another spring with hymns,  
And I will ask you to hand me your hand,  
And together we shall go on a pilgrimage,  
Until the sun sets on the horizon in our eyes.
