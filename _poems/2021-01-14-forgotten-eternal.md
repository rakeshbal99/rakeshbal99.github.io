description: "A poem about journey, survival, and the choice to protect."
---

I asked my heart, where is the start,  
And so I heard a whisper, by the whisker.  
Stopping by the freeway on a rainy night,  
Deprived of the room for choice,  
I stare at a new journey, a new world,  
The snowy springs, the sultry glaciers  
Trying their best to stop the plan.

Midway on the highway, I realise,  
I am a vessel for others,  
A vessel in the land of wolves,  
All striving to frighten my fear of fright.

In the foils of time,  
I find myself in the realms of justice,  
The world is worth saving,  
Without the idea of what I am facing,  
It is a journey through the shackles,  
And In the mist of chaos, what do I choose  
I choose the survival of my species.

With errs a lot on the way,  
I ask myself over and over,  
Was there a way that twilight,  
The answer perhaps lies in the question,

It is indeed an illusion of choice,  
But I shall fight back what is truly ours,  
And this earth is all that we possess,  
Not the money, not the house,  
The lands the oceans the mountains,  
The rivers the deserts the dunes,  
And at this moment, my journey ends as a forgotten eternal.
