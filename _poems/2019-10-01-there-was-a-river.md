description: "A poem about a river and its legacy."
---

Once upon a time  
A river flowed in a land  
Giving life to everyone  
And ending up in a sand.

The river loved the people  
People loved the river back  
Hoards travelled across the river  
Without sign of any panic or attack.

The lands belonged to tribes  
Who were far away from the infernal  
But happiness is short lived,  
And pain eternal.

The river saw many wars many lives  
Red it's colour  
She asked herself if  
Anyone had any brother.

One fine day they decided  
To build a road  
The spirit of the remorseful river  
Left once and for all her heavenly abode.

The perennial river is lost forever  
And her spirit wandering  
Looking for a last ray of hope  
To find a beautiful spring.

Stories were told of the river  
By those who had lived by it's side forever  
And all of them started with  
Once upon a time there was a river.
