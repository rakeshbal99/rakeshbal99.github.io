description: "A poem about cold nights and contemplation."
---

The chill'd nights of long forever last,  
To my bosom, my clingings of past,  
Those longings of night sure stay closer,  
Just enough to break my sanity kosher;

My sanity has been long gone in vanity,  
To the leaves of reason hanging in gravity,  
Of so many ideologs, of so many creators,  
Never before have they faced such amateurs;

The art of demonstration is now demonic,  
The art of contemplation is now monotonic,  
My heart can take in this elegy so much,  
Your heart I hope is blessed more such,

Come, sing the sorrow song of our existence,  
Trodden by the usurpers, we are all manures,  
Of the land that once belong'd to us grateful,  
Now it's theirs, in heaven, in hell, delightfully vengeful.
