description: "A poem about heroism, sacrifice, and the call to fight."

Because I do not fall to fall again,  
Because I do not fall,  
Because I do not fall to rise,  
Like the soothing song singing the rain,  
In a vehicle ascending the skies,  
I am your wrath and I am your fright,  
But why should you trust me with all your might?

I took the ruined ruins from the fallen,  
Hoping to change eternity,  
Dreaming the dream of my father,  
With rage nimble in my veins,  
I fell prey to the world, the cruel world,  
But I do not hope to hope again,  
Because I am not a hero.

I know now what I shall not know,  
I shall willingly strive to strive,  
Changing your reluctant heart  
I will fill your souls with fire,  
Because all of you are keepers of the tale,  
The tellers of which shall depend on your prevail.

Although I do not fall to fall again  
Although I do not fall  
Although I do not fall to rise  
I will take a step closer to that truth,  
The truth of my world, hidden,  
Forbidden by the usurpers,  
Why do you deserve to know the truth?  
Because heroes were they, your comrades,  
And you, my friend, you are the same.

The Fate of Humanity,  
Will be Decided in this very moment,  
Hearing my cry you have no choice,  
Because all of you are heroes;  
With one arm in the field,  
I am not a bystander,  
I am a Smith of the devil,  
And in the end,  I will give up my dream  
Raising my hand, riding my fall, I shall scream,  
Heishi Yo Ikare!  
Heishi Yo Sakebe!  
Heishi Yo Tatakae!
