description: "A poem about stillness, collapse, and hope."
---

Today as I think of nothing,  
Buildings fall, societies collapse,  
And History in all its glory,  
Crumbles down to its very core.

The other day when I was working,  
Everything was just about fine,  
Today as I stop dreaming all this while,  
The world stops at my feet, at my doorstep.

Everything that I lost along the way,  
The wave, the pavements, the caves,  
Everything comes back to me today,  
Losing their value in their own graves.

I will know the rules to break it,  
I have to know my past to undo it,  
I shall know the structure to shatter it,  
I know my future enough to stop it.

Today as I shed my caveman clothes,  
I see a new world, a new slope.  
In all its Whistles and Rhymes,  
The new world promises of nothing, but hope.

I know my random scribbling is in vain,  
Yet whenever you get reminded of this day,  
Remember that, the day as humanity broke,  
I was sitting in my couch, puffing a smoke,  
Watching the buildings fall and civilization collapse;  
And in that moment I was doing nothing but  
I was thinking of not thinking.
