description: "A poem about equality, struggle, and leaving a legacy"
---

Dwelling into the mud I found  
Equality is a myth,  
Propagated by those who lack the reasoning,  
Championed by those who lack the understanding,  
It is not my right nor yours; it is the right of the people;  
The people who fought the hardest  
But the voices of those are heard  
Who sob the most;  
The ones who cry from within  
Are those who are the weakest;  
No situation can weaken you  
You are your one true enemy  
Rise and you shall see that all the stars are closer  
Whatever time it is, it shall pass;  
But remember your time is truly yours  
Whenever you shall pass at one with your destiny  
That legacy is yours.
