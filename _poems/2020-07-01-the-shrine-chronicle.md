I used to write under the shrine  
Letting my heart flow once in a while  
The panic of the first, relief of the last line  
Finding the words worth a smile.

Now as I find myself as the chosen one  
After all this while in the dream, O Lord  
I shall descend to where the real was won  
And I pray thee, From Ignorance lead me to the Truth,  
From Darkness lead me to the Light,  
From Death lead me to the Eternal, O Lord

II.

O Darkness Reveal Thy Face, I have come for thee  
As we fight each other for the Time Senary,  
I see you have done something to the place,  
Fear, not my friend, For it, shall be  
The last night of your anomaly.

As I recollect, you are an agent of sorts  
Remember the purpose of life is not the end  
Its the journey, the ascends, the descends  
Its the problem of choice, the choice to persist;  
Dare not my friend, For thou shalt feel  
My wrath against thy rising odds.

All of you shall watch me destroy you,  
And our fight will be witnessed by the Gods;  
Tired of your sins, are they, all your boons and curses;  
Reluctant yet hopeless, they have struck a deal with me,  
For it ends today and a new story reloads.

III.

This is the place where the east meets the west  
Where all my sins wash away  
Portraying myself as the trinity one  
Thou shalt be the judge  
To my devotion  
The rhythm of the one  
The meaning of the other  
I am the one and yet I am no one  
But I hope to die for humanity, Even if it's not real  
My defeat shall bring peace to both worlds  
And the new sun shall shine right where you stand  
And this is how my world ends  
Not with a bang but a whimper.
