description: "A poem about an ancient place."

It was a thousand years old  
Many a men lived and died  
By it's shore. The pristine remnants  
Wave until it is no more.

There will you see a Sleeping man  
Five brothers too  
But none too glorified  
Than the third one.

Crimson eyes  
Show the future havoc  
And the pillars that reach the skies  
Show the wrath of the creepers.

The sphere is balanced by the wheel  
Showing the birth of the mighty stream  
The Lord of the Southern river  
Replacing his father.

With a feet away from the hexagon  
And a fleet away from the land of tea  
Steadfast even from the floods  
It has stood against the test of time.
