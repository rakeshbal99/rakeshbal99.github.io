What should I write today?  
This feeling of intense desire  
Trying so hard to flesh out  
The questions of deep enquire.

What should I write tomorrow?  
The answer is right there  
About today, because in retrospect  
You shall find your true despair.

What should I write yesterday?  
Wait, isn't that time gone?  
But isn't that what you do all the time?  
Trying to fill the perfect story from dusk to dawn.

Time is perhaps the only eternal truth  
At last, I have found my answer in the truman  
I shall forever sing the song of time  
Because it is what makes me human.
