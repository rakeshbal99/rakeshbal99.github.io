description: "A poem with film references about identity and hope."

Once while I was driving on the Mulholland Drive  
I felt trapped inside the labyrinth of identity.  
The spotlight was on my primal fear,  
And I found myself searching for the subsequent redemption.

Split into two pieces, my soul  
Spirited away, leaving my enemy behind.  
Prisoned deep inside the vertigo of apocalypse  
I waved for help from strangers as far as the Zodiac.

Devoid of any help from this country  
I had no choice but to make  
Rage my only primer, as the only pulp left in me was  
The atonement from the departed.

Shining from the eternal touched my heart,  
Carrying the last memento of hope  
And there I discovered a strange love  
For this world, this tree of life.

At last, I tried to get out of myself  
Which transported me back to the future  
My soul by my side making me realise  
This is the hallway of inception.
