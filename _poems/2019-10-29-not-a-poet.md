description: "A poem about dreams and writing."
---

You wonder about dreams  
Where you find a world of worldless emotions  
You rise through the staircase  
Where you find a thousand triolets.

You imagine conversations  
Between the brain and the heart.  
And you find a way to transit  
Between the famous and the addict.

You stare at pale blue walls  
Looking beyond the lawn to the countryside  
You sail alone by the sea  
Even though there are no boundaries you confide.

You seek the lyric of the ice-cream cone  
Constantly burying yourself in the bird-watchers club  
You find yourself at the broken pagoda  
Endlessly writing about the glory snub.

When things don't go as expected  
You are besotted into the better  
When heroes are no more the way,  
You write to them the last letter.

When you lie about love  
You have a company of madmen aligned  
You are not a poet, but  
You have put a mayhem in my mind.
