description: "A poem about flowers, memories, and love."
---

Like a yellow flower, I remembered your dream,  
Like the train moving slowly between stations,  
I try to tie to my dying luck with your fortune,  
Like the houseboat moving over backwaters,  
I float back and forth over your tidal words;  
Sometimes sweet, sometimes sassy.

Like a red flower, I remember your warmth,  
Like the sunset over the hills in the crimson  
I try to find your soul in the midst of my desire,  
Hoping to find you with me in that paradise,  
Like the spices in the hills of Malabar gardens,  
I try to savour your looks from the seasons,  
Sometimes hot, sometimes sultry.

And like a green flower, you are my life, my breath,  
I search for your beautiful face in my miseries,  
Like the earrings with your golden smile embedded,  
Like the matching black bangles on one hand,  
I wish to fill your life with all you deserve,  
Sometimes joy, sometimes strength.
