description: "A poem about love, wonder, and enchantment."
---

With the sea velvet worn,  
With the gaze beneath born,  
I see your heavenly smile from afar,  
Can I reach for you like a star?

In the somber stems of the cadence,  
In the amber streets of florence,  
I find your divine presence gleam,  
Can I search for you like a dream?

The serene bubbles of your attire,  
The subtle troubles of desire,  
I seek the wind passing the farm,  
Can I place your memory like a charm?

In the midnight rhythm of the crystals above,  
In the twilight transit of the first love,  
I am now lost in the woods in the snow,  
Or in the building in the glow?

No, I am lost in your form enchanted,  
I have none but two wishes granted;  
I just want to hold your hand.  
I just want to travel your world.
