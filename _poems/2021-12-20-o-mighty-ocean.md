description: "A poem about love, nature, and running out of words."
---

O mighty Ocean take my words, And make her glee;  
Draped in the golden rays, my days started with her,  
Wrapped in the silver sheen, my nights ended with her,  
Tell her when I wake up, I find myself beside her free.

O mighty Sky count thy stars, And make her gaze;  
As the sun sets with a blush, in the half-turn of dark,  
Her form rises in crimson, And flies start their spark,  
Tell the moon not to envy, And write verses to her praise.

O mighty Earth paint thy woods, with hues happy be;  
Of springs and autumns together, of songs, of melodies,  
And Before the river goes away, remind her of my memories,  
I pray, Whisper to her, my heart plucked one line after another,  
From her eternal portraits, but forgive me, my dear,  
In the search for meaning, I am running out of words for thee.
