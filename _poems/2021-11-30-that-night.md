description: "A poem about friendship, failure, and diverging paths."

That night after midnight,  
Sleepless in wake of night,  
Awaiting the fake of the might,  
We called our friends to wake us,  
And friends were they, cycling together,  
In black suits and shiny shoes,  
Waiting for your turn, were you  
And the time finally arrived,  
One round after another, it ended on a low  
Failing together, we stayed there  
The agony of the reverb pain;  
With second chance on the way, I took  
A different turn, leaving you my friend,  
Behind for a second day, the same pain,  
But I pray for you my friend,  
You will achieve your dreams  
Even if they are different,  
And we shall forever remember,  
The moonlight as it faded on us together,  
On that fateful day, taking the turn right,  
On that sleepy dark night.
